# Panama Canal Lock Water Usage Calculator

This tool estimates freshwater loss and savings during ship transits through the Panama Canal using ship tonnage, lock type, and physical approximations. It calculates water displaced, water lost, and potential annual savings or costs based on both theoretical models and real-world monthly data extracted from research presentations.

Developed during a **Department of Defense–sponsored project** focused on freshwater conservation in the Panama Canal, the tool was used to visualize researched data and simulate different water usage scenarios. It provides a flexible way to tweak variables like ship size or transit count and see the effects on water consumption and efficiency.

## What It Does
- Models water usage per ship transit
- Calculates displacement, water loss, and estimated cost
- Compares baseline loss vs. Goldilocks (bladder-enhanced) lock systems
- Visualizes monthly and annual loss using actual 2024 data

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – core logic and data modeling  
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** – numerical analysis and visualization
